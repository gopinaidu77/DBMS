            <summary>1. Explain file-based systems and compare them with DBMS. [cite: 13]</summary>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>File-based systems store data in separate files. They lack security, data integrity, and concurrent access support. [cite: 14]</p>
                <p>DBMS solves these issues by using a centralized system with constraints, multi-user access, transaction support, and better storage mechanisms. [cite: 15]</p>
                <p>It enhances consistency and avoids redundancy. [cite: 16]</p>
            </div>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>2. Describe the three-level architecture of DBMS. [cite: 16]</summary>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The three levels are: [cite: 17]</p>
                <p>	• External level: user view. [cite: 17]</p>
                <p>	• Conceptual level: logical structure. [cite: 17]</p>
                <p>	• Internal level: physical storage. [cite: 17]</p>
                <p>This separation allows independence between data structure and storage. [cite: 18]</p>
            </div>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>3. Discuss different data models in DBMS. [cite: 18]</summary>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Data models describe how data is organized. Hierarchical model uses parent-child relationships. Network model allows complex relationships. [cite: 19]</p>
                <p>Relational model uses tables. Object-oriented model integrates object features. [cite: 20]</p>
            </div>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>4. Explain various database languages supported by DBMS. [cite: 20]</summary>

                <p>	• DML (Data Manipulation Language): Handles data. [cite: 21]</p>
                <p>	• DCL (Data Control Language): Manages permissions. [cite: 22]</p>
                <p>	• TCL (Transaction Control Language): Manages transactions. [cite: 22]</p>
                <p>Each type plays a vital role in handling and securing data efficiently. [cite: 23]</p>
            </div>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>5. What are relational algebra operations? Explain with examples. [cite: 24]</summary>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>They include Select, Project, Union, Set Difference, Cartesian Product, Rename, Join, and Division. [cite: 24]</p>
                <p>These operations help retrieve and manipulate data from relational databases. [cite: 25]</p>
                <p>For example, Select filters data while Join combines data from multiple tables. [cite: 26]</p>
            </div>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>6. Explain Join and Division operations in relational algebra. [cite: 26]</summary>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Join combines two relations on a common attribute to retrieve meaningful information. [cite: 27]</p>
                <p>Division is used when we need results that match all values in a related set, such as finding students enrolled in all courses. [cite: 28]</p>
            </div>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>7. Explain integrity constraints in detail. [cite: 28]</summary>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>They include: [cite: 29]</p>
                <p>	• Primary Key: Uniquely identifies a record. [cite: 29]</p>
                <p>	• Foreign Key: Links two tables. [cite: 29]</p>
                <p>	• Check: Enforces a condition. [cite: 30]</p>
                <p>	• Not Null: Prevents null values. [cite: 30]</p>
                <p>These constraints ensure consistency, accuracy, and proper linking of records. [cite: 31]</p>
            </div>
